The Music Tree - Applicaton 

The main aim of "The Music Tree" (Mu Tree) is to be the most complete musical database in the world. Always under the premise of relating authorship with musical works. But with additional features such as filtering by musical styles, by dates, the branching of versions of a musical piece, etc.

Another target of this platform, and no less ambitious, is to make it technologically relevant with an attractive graphical interface based on graph visual tools. With a powerful UI both in its interactivity and in its graphical quality.

This platform borns as a social and collaborative application. Social and collaborative in two ways, because of, on the one hand, it is intended that the developer community help its implementation and constant improvement, and on the other hand, it is intended that the community of music lovers collaborate with the incorporation of data and the validation of these.
