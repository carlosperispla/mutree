The Music Tree - Applicaton 

The main aim of "The Music Tree" (Mu Tree) is to be the most complete musical database in the world. Always under the premise of relating authorship with musical works. But with additional features such as filtering by musical styles, by dates, the branching of versions of a musical piece, etc.

Another target of this platform, and no less ambitious, is to make it technologically relevant with an attractive graphical interface based on graph visual tools. With a powerful UI both in its interactivity and in its graphical quality.

This platform borns as a social and collaborative application. Social and collaborative in two ways, because of, on the one hand, it is intended that the developer community helps its implementation and constant improvement, and on the other hand, it is intended that the community of music lovers collaborates with the incorporation of data and the validation of these.

This idea is born from the mind of Carlos Peris, software engineer and music lover. Of his interest in finding information about the music he hears, about who the authors are, who have versioned those songs. These searches have always led him to navigate huge amounts of web pages and other social tools such as Wikipedia, sometimes successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully. It has been a process of years that in the end has culminated with a patent reality. There is no open access tool on the Internet and complete in the style of Wikipedia or IMDB that meets this need.

Once, the Mu Tree, see the light, will be the ideal tool to make interesting searches related to music, for music lovers, radiolocutors, and people who like music in general who have concerns to know who has done what musical works , who has versioned them, in which albums have been them published, etc.
